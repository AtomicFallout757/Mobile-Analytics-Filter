! Title: Mobile Analytics Filter For iOS
! Version: 1.0.1

! Description: A simple filter that blocks various analytics on iOS devices. It blocks most analytics domains that aren't blocked by other lists (e.g. EasyPrivacy, etc.) but it does not block domains that are already blocked by other, popular lists, and thus this filter is best used alongside those other lists.
